title: "Who am I?"
draft: false

Originally my life goal was to study medicine and be a surgeon, but something changed when I started to explore online games, I was obsessed to know how they were created and see the internal functioning so I started creating very basic websites for my friends just to to learn. I can say that my interest in programming was born approximately in 2004 and since then I decided to study Computer Science, I graduated in high school as an IT Technician and by 2015 I already had advanced knowledge in the web world.

I have participated in several public and private projects and I have always looked for the most optimal way to do them. I like the programming of applications for all types of devices and one of my goals is to create someday a game like the ones I played as a child.

I have discovered what I like, what I love and what I want to continue doing the rest of my life: Being a developer.
